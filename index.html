        <h1>About me</h1>
        <p>Hello, I'm Cintia and I live in the Bay Area in California. I work as a Software Engineer at Yahoo! and I
            enjoy messing around with fun web stuff.</p>
        <p>I recently got my Master's degree at Carnegie Mellon University as a Master of Entertainment Technology,
            which is most awesome degree to have (in my opinion). I have a reasonable knowledge in HTML5, CSS3 and
            JavaScript, which allows me to make The Web a nicer place to be.</p>
        <p>I am very interested in everything that comes out for web development and I am always trying new stuff,
            specially if it promises to end up in a very fun result - it doesn't matter how hard its path might be to
            get to the final awesomeness.</p>
        <p>I don't consider myself a designer, but I am always picking some of my designer friends' brains to create
            new experiences and for play testing my most recent "experiment".</p>
