            <h1>About me</h1>
            <p>Hello, I'm Cintia and I live in the Bay Area in California. I work as a Front End Software Engineer at Yahoo! and I
                enjoy messing around with fun web stuff.</p>
            <p>I recently got my Master's degree at Carnegie Mellon University as a Master of Entertainment Technology,
                which is most awesome degree to have (in my opinion). I have a reasonable knowledge in HTML5, CSS3 and
                JavaScript, which allows me to make The Web a nicer place to be.</p>
            <p>I am very interested in everything that comes out for web development and I am always trying new stuff,
                specially if it promises to end up in a very fun result - it doesn't matter how hard its path might be to
                get to the final awesomeness.</p>
            <p>I don't consider myself a designer, but I am always picking some of my designer friends' brains to create
                new experiences and for play testing my most recent "experiment".</p>
